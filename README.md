# Robotics Pick And Place Manipulator

EGR 598 Topic: Robotic Systems I - August 2018 - December 2018

For the final project of Robotic Systems 1, we were tasked with building a pick and place manipulator.

The manipulator involved Python code to find the object in the robot workspace with a camera. PSoC code then used inverse kinematics to find the joint variable values which place the end-effector in that location, move to the location, turn on the electromagnet, move the electromagnet down with the rack and pinion, move the electromagnet back up, move the end-effector to the 'drop' location, and turn off the electromagnet.
